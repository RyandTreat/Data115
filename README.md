# Data115
For my Data115 class
Motivation
For this project I wanted to answer some questions about the video game industry. The couple questions I had in mind are:
Based on IGN reviews what genre seemed to have the overall better reviews.
Did any specific publisher or developer seem to have a better track record vs others.
What game title had the best over all review
Did a reviewer at IGN leave better reviews over all

Data Process
I went through IGN and grabbed the scores, titles ,genre and the person who left the review and looked up developers and publishers to round out the set. At the end if there were
blanks I would either remove them or go back and find the missing piece. I also would make judgement calls on the genre i didnt want too many and tried to keep them limited.
After using my best judgement to decide a single genre i went through and removed games that belonged to a genre that only had 1-9 titles to try and keep the data small and simple
Other than that this data did not need to much cleaning before it could be used
